    like survival and threshold.  This can be bettet
- Refactor API source - break up functionality for easier maintenance and
    extensibility.
- Manage requests via a separate Job Controller (JC).
    user_metrics.api.engine.request_manager module.

    build_key_signature method in user_metrics.api.engine.data


Version 0.1.4-dev
-----------------

To be released on March 26th 2013.

- User Session Management (session.py)
    - flask-login
- Implementation of request caching outside the runtime
    - start with pickle objects
- Initial commit for client for programmatically accessing API
    -> https://github.com/rfaulkner/umapi_client
- More robust testing.
    - added some testing
- Interface to load cohorts
- Request notifications listener (RNL) that handle
- Update request_manager module to handle larger responses on the queue
- Response Handler (RH) that builds responses for caching as they finish
- Add backend facility for loading cohorts
    (add_cohort_data in query_calls module)
- Add backend facility for registering users (session.py)
- Fixed API views to properly interact with callbacks managing requests,

Future Work
-----------

- Redefine API request entry points:
    * run/cohort/..
    * run/set/..
    * run/user/..
- Build filters that allow new cohorts to be generated from requests
- OAuth/OpenID integration.  This is essential for programmatic access.
- HTTPS
